# SOS Game Java UI Project

The SOS Game Java UI Project is a simple implementation of the classic SOS game using Java and a graphical user interface. This repository contains the source code and necessary files to build and run the application.

## Features

- **Interactive UI**: Easy-to-use graphical interface.
- **Player vs. Player**: Two-player mode where players can compete against each other.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of players' scores during the game.

## Installation

   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd SOS-Game-Java-UI-Project-
   ```
3. **Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).**
4. **Build the project** to resolve dependencies and compile the code.

## Usage

1. **Run the application from your IDE**: Execute the main class to start the game.
2. **Gameplay**: Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## Game Rules

- **Objective**: Create the sequence "SOS" either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
- **Turn-Based**: Players take turns to place either an 'S' or an 'O' on the grid.
- **Scoring**: Each valid "SOS" sequence scores a point.
- **Winning**: The player with the highest score when the grid is full wins the game.
